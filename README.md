# BLOSSOM-SCA-toolset

The BLOSSOM project is an instantiation of a Flexible, Customizable, Fast Side Channel Attack Trace collection and management architecture.
It relies on Hardware Testing platforms that follow a two FPGA approach, a control FPGA and a Device under Test FGPA (Cryptography FPGA). A typical such example, commercially available, is the SASEBO/SAKURA boards. 
Currently te project is implemented for the SAKURA X board.
